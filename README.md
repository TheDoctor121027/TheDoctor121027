# Hello there, I'm the Doctor 👋

I stream on YouTube and Twitch. I run my own minecraft server network, IP available on my website and I am still a beginner in terms of programming, one reason for this is I am very much self taught. One thing that allowed me to learn so much about programming is VRChat. Developing my world has taught me so much.

## Skills
- 🌐 | HTML | CSS |
- 🎮 | C# | U# (VRChat Specific) | UGraph (VRChat Specific) |
## What am I doing?
- 🔭 I’m currently working on development for my vrchat world, my website and my YouTube and Twitch 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and U# and excited to learn more languages.
