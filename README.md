# About Me

**I'm the Doctor,** a Time Lord and Demon Lord, embarking upon my **121,027th regeneration.** ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ

ðŸ”® **What I Do:**
- **YouTube & Twitch:** Stay updated with my latest escapades and streams. Dive into a universe of entertainment that transcends the ordinary.
- **Minecraft Server:** Join my server for endless adventures in my custom-built servers. Together, we'll explore the unknown, crafting stories worth telling across the cosmos.
- **Coding Odyssey:** Embarking on a journey through the realms of code, I'm currently learning advanced HTML & CSS, alongside diving into the mysteries of C# and U# (specific to VRChat). Not stopping there, I'm unraveling the complexities of Ugraph (also VRChat-specific) and am thrilled at the prospect of mastering more programming languages. With each line of code, I draw closer to weaving the very fabric of digital realms.

ðŸŒ  **Journey Beyond:** Ready yourself for an extraordinary voyage through time, space, and boundless creativity. With a TARDIS brimming with wonders, each moment promises unparalleled excitement.

ðŸ”„ **Regeneration #121,027:** Witness the evolution of an interdimensional wanderer. Each life, a new story; each moment, a memory eternal.
